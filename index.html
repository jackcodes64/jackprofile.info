        <h3><i>Why I Chose Computer Science and What Keeps Me Going</i></h3>
        <p>Choosing to pursue a degree in Computer Science was one of the best decisions I've made. <br>
        It started with my fascination with technology, but it has evolved into a passion for solving problems and building solutions. <br>
        In this post, I'll share my journey so farâ€”what inspired me, the challenges I've faced,
        and the future I envision in the tech world. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3><i>The Crux...</i></h3>
    <p>
        From my early exposure to computers in high school to <br>
        discovering the joy of coding at Moi University, my journey has been an exciting learning curve. <br>
        I still remember the first time I wrote a program in C, the sense of achievement I felt, and how that propelled me to keep learning more. <br>
        Along the way, I've learned how to work with languages like <b>C++, JavaScript, Java, Python, Kotlin, HTML</b>, and <b>CSS,</b> built simple websites, <br>
        and even dabbled in <b>cybersecurity</b> practices like network traffic analysis with Wireshark and similar tools.  <br>
        My experience with <b>MySQL</b> has shown me the importance of managing data efficiently to ensure smooth user experiences. <br>
        Additionally, knowing how the <b>Operating Systems</b> handles system resources has allowed me to build more robust and responsive applications. <br> 
        Hardware knowledge also comes into play, <br>
        ensuring that the physical infrastructure can support the demands of modern systems. <br>
        But beyond the technical skills, it's the problem-solving mindset that keeps me hooked. <br>
        Its not always easy, but every challenge teaches me something new. <br>
